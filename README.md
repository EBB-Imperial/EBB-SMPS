# ELEC50008 - Engineering Design Project 2
## Project Brief: Maze solving robot
## PV panels initial test



## Emulating a PV panel

You are requested to design and build a balancing robot (segway) that can autonomously map and navigate a maze. A prototype of the design must be built and tested in the artificial maze in the lab. The maze is laid out with light strips on an arena. The arena is coloured black and surrounded by black curtains.
